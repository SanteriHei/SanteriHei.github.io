I am a Phd student at the robot learning lab at Aalto University, under the
supervision of Prof. Joni Pajarinen. My main research interests include 
multi-objective reinforcement learning and constrained reinforcement learning. 
More specifically, I am interested in how reinforcement learning could
be applied in a more broad set of real-world tasks, which often requires
considering multiple, possibly time-varying constraints. This issue can be 
also seen from the multi-objective viewpoint, where the constraints are
alternative, conflicting objectives, and one has to find optimal policies for
considering different viewpoints. Currently, I am working on advancing 
reinforcement learning approaches for discrete optimization problems with
large search-spaces.


Previously, I received BSc degree in computer science from Tampere University
in 2022, and I expect to receive my MSc degree in computer science from Tampere
University during fall 2024. My MSc thesis studied the effect of
soft-information sharing between policies in multi-objective reinforcement,
and it was supervised by Prof. Ville Kyrki from [Intelligent Robotics group](https://irobotics.aalto.fi/)
at Aalto University.
